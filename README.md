## 📝 About

This repository contains a theoretical explanation of supervised classification algorithms. The purpose is to provide a visual and textual summary of eight major classification models, detailing how they work and when to use them. The project is structured for clarity in both English and Spanish, and includes additional code examples.


It is designed to support:
- 📚 Students  
- 🧑‍🏫 Educators  
- 🧪 Beginner Data Scientists  

Content is provided in both **English** and **Spanish**, with theoretical explanation and simplified language for easier understanding.

    <td valign="middle">Logistic Regression is a simple way to predict if something is one thing or another (like yes/no, or cat/dog) using some information. It gives you a probability (a number between 0 and 1) of which it's more likely to be.</td>
